## Stack
Built with Next.JS and TailwindCSS 

## Philosophy
Open-source, user-experience first, free forever.

## Motivation
I started this project because I'm tired of being locked into ecosystems and forced to use corporate apps just to get a good-looking, lightweight tool suite. I need something that works, and if it doesn't, I can fix it myself. No guessing, no praying that it works - just minimal downtime and maximum optimization for my workflow. All in one place, with full control over my data and access to all features, free of charge.

## History
This started as a small project for a JavaScript course on Codedex and evolved into what it is now.

## Installation
ill edit this later when i actually get a working version going 😭
